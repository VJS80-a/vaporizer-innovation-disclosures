**Inventor:** Ville Johannes Savolainen  
**Disclosure Type:** Public Prior Art

## Summary

This document describes an advanced heater design for vaporization devices, where two or more spiral-formed metal foils are used instead of one. This design allows for improved surface area, better heat transfer efficiency, and optional power/current control strategies by selectively activating each foil depending on required heat output.

## Background

A similar spiral foil heater concept has been used in the Ti N YM ig ht herbal vaporizers since 2019. These heaters are constructed from thin stainless steel foil, often around 0.05mm thick, which is rolled into a spiral and supported using rods or structural features to maintain spacing between layers. The spiral is typically enclosed in a tube, although in newer designs, the foil itself is extended and wrapped around to form a self-supporting shell.

The heater operates with current flowing from a center conductor (e.g., a central axle) to the outer foil termination. Spot-welded nickel strips, silver/copper wires, or shaped foil ends may be used to conduct current. Methods such as welding, laser welding, adhesives, or conductive pastes may be used for assembly.

## Dual Foil Heater Concept

By using two thinner foils (e.g., 0.025mm each) within the same spiral geometry:
- The surface area is effectively doubled.
- Each foil can be controlled independently or together.
- When only half the power is needed, activating just one foil cuts the current draw in half.
- Reduces peak battery stress (e.g., 10A instead of 20A).
- Improves battery lifespan and system efficiency.
- PWM control or dual transistor gating can be used to alternate power delivery.

The two foils may be spot welded or joined at one end (e.g., the center), and routed separately at the other end to allow independent control. They must be insulated from each other where separation is needed, which can be achieved using ceramic paste, mica, or structural separation.

Alternatively, both foils may be connected in parallel for simplicity, allowing a larger combined surface area and optimized heating distribution.

## Advantages

- Lower instantaneous current draw
- Extended battery life
- Adaptive heat delivery
- Potential for dual-temperature zones
- Improved manufacturing flexibility

## Intent

This disclosure is published to establish prior art and prevent exclusive patent claims on dual- or multi-foil spiral heaters with selective or parallel power control systems.
