# Dual-Foil Spiral Heater and Adaptive Power Control

**Date of Disclosure:** 2025-04-18  
**Inventor:** Ville Johannes Savolainen  
**Disclosure Type:** Public Prior Art

## Summary

This document describes an advanced heater design for vaporization devices, where two or more spiral-formed metal foils are used instead of one. This design allows for improved surface area, better heat transfer efficiency, and optional power/current control strategies by selectively activating each foil depending on required heat output.

## Background

A similar spiral foil heater concept has been used in the Ti N YM ig ht herbal vaporizers since 2019. These heaters are constructed from thin stainless steel foil, often around 0.05mm thick, which is rolled into a spiral and supported using rods or structural features to maintain spacing between layers. The spiral is typically enclosed in a tube, although in newer designs, the foil itself is extended and wrapped around to form a self-supporting shell.

The heater operates with current flowing from a center conductor (e.g., a central axle) to the outer foil termination. Spot-welded nickel strips, silver/copper wires, or shaped foil ends may be used to conduct current. Methods such as welding, laser welding, adhesives, or conductive pastes may be used for assembly.

## Dual Foil Heater Concept

By using two thinner foils (e.g., 0.025mm each) within the same spiral geometry:
- The surface area is effectively doubled.
- Each foil can be controlled independently or together.
- When only half the power is needed, activating just one foil cuts the current draw in half.
- Reduces peak battery stress (e.g., 10A instead of 20A).
- Improves battery lifespan and system efficiency.
- PWM control or dual transistor gating can be used to alternate power delivery.

The two foils may be spot welded or joined at one end (e.g., the center), and routed separately at the other end to allow independent control. They must be insulated from each other where separation is needed, which can be achieved using ceramic paste, mica, or structural separation.

Alternatively, both foils may be connected in parallel for simplicity, allowing a larger combined surface area and optimized heating distribution.

## Advantages

- Lower instantaneous current draw
- Extended battery life
- Adaptive heat delivery
- Potential for dual-temperature zones
- Improved manufacturing flexibility

 ## Expanded Variations and Broader Scope ## (Added 2025-04-28)

This section expands on the core disclosure to ensure coverage of a wide range of potential implementations, adaptations, and variations of the dual-path spiral foil heater design. The intent is to ensure the described concept is established as prior art in its broader form and prevent any party from claiming exclusive rights to variations that fall under the same core principle.

  - Stacked flat
  - Twisted or layered in parallel but not physically touching

### 2. Electrical Configurations

- Dual or multiple foils may be wired:
  - In **series** (to increase resistance)
  - In **parallel** (to divide current)
  - Independently, with separate MOSFETs or control drivers
- Power may be modulated:
  - Alternating activation (pulsed)

  - Anodized metals as aluminum
  - using oxidation of the resistive material as insulation
- Structural housings may include:
  - Glass
  - Metal tubes
  - Ceramic cylinders
  - Self-supporting foil shells

### 5. Dynamic Control Methods

- Heater activation may be controlled by:
  - Software-driven temperature regulation

  - Sensor feedback (e.g., airflow, temperature, battery voltage)
- Modes may include:
  - Low-power single-foil mode
  - High-power dual-foil mode
  - Alternating foil pulses (e.g., 10ms switching)
  - Adaptive current control based on real-time conditions

- Heater cartridges may be:
  - Permanently integrated
  - User-replaceable
  - Hot-swappable
- Contacts and mounts may include:
  - Threaded connections
  - Push-fit electrical terminals
  - Spring-loaded contacts

### 7. Alternative Foil Arrangements

- In addition to spirals, foils may be:
  - Zigzag patterned
  - Serpentine path
  - Layered in flat stacks
  - Rolled into tubes or folded geometries
- Geometry may be designed to emphasize:
  - Surface area for convection
  - Radiant heating efficiency
