## 1. Designs Combining Heater Technologies for More Effective Vaporization

The spiral foil heater is a very efficient convection heater, allowing heat to transfer to airflow thanks to a large surface area and very low mass, meaning not much energy is stored in the heater itself. Updated designs such as removing the tube around the spiral, and even the possibility of eliminating the central rod of the heater, further reduce the mass that gets heated, improving overall efficiency.

However, challenges arise because the device's goal is not just to heat air, but to **vaporize material** effectively so that a **usable aerosol/vapor** is formed. Practical issues include the **inevitable temperature difference** between the herb and the hot airflow, as well as the **temperature of the structures** surrounding the material to be vaporized.

For instance, if a container for the plant material is initially at room temperature, it may take some time for it to warm up enough in the hot airflow to avoid disrupting the vaporization process. The typical effect is **uneven heating**, with **less vaporized material near cold surfaces**, and **delays in vapor formation**, especially during short inhalations.

## 2. Solutions and Optimizations

### 2.1 Thin Herb Container Walls

To mitigate these problems, the structures around the herb can be made as **thin as possible**. One feature we've implemented is a **herb-holding container made of thin stainless steel**, such as 0.05 mm thick. This minimizes energy storage and allows the container to heat up very fast.

This can be improved further by **routing a small portion of the airflow around the outside of the container wall**, then allowing it to **enter through side holes** into the herb chamber. This has two effects:
- Heats the container wall faster
- Injects hot air directly into the herb chamber from the sides

We have named this approach **"Conveduction"** — a combination of **convection heating** with **conduction-like effects** caused by redirected airflow.

### 2.2 Conduction Heating Containers

Another method we've implemented uses a **simple conduction chamber**. In this setup:
- The herb is placed in a container heated by a **resistive heating element**, or
- A **heated tubular part** with an embedded resistance heater transfers energy to a **detachable chamber** that accepts herb material

This allows the container to reach operating temperature quickly and begin transferring heat to both the herb and the air inside the chamber.

## 3. Latest Design – Convection Combined with Infrared (IR) Radiation

Our most advanced system integrates **convection heating** with **IR radiation** for superior performance.

### 3.1 Principle and Operation

This system uses an **IR-radiating material** surrounding the herb chamber. Rather than just heating the container surface and letting that heat transfer conductively, the **IR radiation directly penetrates the herbal material**. This allows for **internal heating** from the start, improving vaporization efficiency.

When hot airflow follows, the material is already internally warmed, eliminating **cold spots**, accelerating vapor formation, and significantly improving vapor **density and consistency**.

### 3.2 Practical Benefits

- **Immediate heating effect** inside the herb
- No lag from cold outer walls or containers
- **Faster full vapor production** — nearly instantaneous
- **Greater vapor concentration**
- Enhanced response for short inhalations

## 4. Construction of the IR Heater

This heater has been prototyped in several forms. One effective version includes:

- A **black-coated thin metal foil** formed into a circular or cylindrical shape
- Electrical contacts at either end to allow **resistive current flow**
- Rapid heat-up of the foil to temperatures like **420°C**, **500°C**, or **600°C**, depending on design needs

The herb is placed **at the center of the structure**, **without touching the hot surface**, where it receives IR radiation from all directions.

---

### 4.1 Containment and Separation Materials

To prevent direct contact with the hot radiating foil, the herb can be housed in:

- **IR-transparent tubes** such as **sapphire** or **quartz**
- **Meshes** or **perforated materials**
- Other heat-tolerant structures that allow IR to pass while maintaining physical separation

## 5. Summary and Intent

This disclosure describes a **multi-modal heating system** for vaporizers that leverages:
- **Convection** from a spiral foil heater
- **Conduction** via preheated containers
- **Infrared radiation** via high-temperature foil

These systems solve the cold-start and uneven-heating challenges in portable vaporizers. The combination yields **immediate**, **deep**, and **efficient** heating, resulting in faster, more consistent, and better-quality vapor production.

This document is published to establish **public prior art**, ensuring that no third party may claim exclusive patent rights to these integrated heater systems or their described configurations.
