## Background

In many portable vaporizers, a common point of failure is the **push button** used to control the device. Failures can occur due to both **mechanical** and **electrical** reasons. The operational environment is particularly harsh due to:

- Generated heat  
- Presence of fine herbal particles  
- Vapor condensation  
- Risk of physical impact (e.g. drops, rough handling)

Typical **tactile switches** used in such devices are fragile and prone to damage in these conditions.

## Our Solution: Solid State Button

We have developed a method to implement a **"solid state button"** for improved reliability and robustness.

### How it works:

- A **magnetic sensor IC** is placed inside the device (commonly on the PCB, though alternative placements are possible).
- The **physical button** that the user presses contains a **magnet**.
- When the button is pressed, the **magnet moves**, and the **sensor detects this movement**.

### Key Benefits:

- **No physical switch** is required — the button becomes purely a mechanical housing with a spring and magnet.
- **Extremely robust** — able to handle impacts and drops without damage
- **Highly resistant** to dirt, dust, and condensation

## Multi-Level Press Detection

An added advantage of this design is that the sensor can detect **multiple positions** along the button’s movement path. This opens the door to more advanced user interface features:

- A **two-stage button press**:
  - First level press: initiate heating
  - Deeper second level press: activate a second function (e.g., temperature boost)

These stages can be **communicated to the user via haptic feedback**, resulting in a so-called **"haptic button"** experience.

## Summary

This innovation offers a **highly durable**, **flexible**, and **intuitive** button mechanism that addresses long-standing issues in portable vaporizer design. It enhances device longevity while enabling advanced input interactions.
