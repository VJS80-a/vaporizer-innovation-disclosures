# Vaporizer Innovation Disclosures

This repository contains original hardware design and technical disclosures authored by **Ville Johannes Savolainen**.

This repository contains technical disclosures of concepts and design innovations related to herbal vaporizer devices. These documents are published to establish **prior art** and prevent third parties from obtaining exclusive patent rights on similar inventions.

All files are timestamped by GitHub’s version control system and may also be archived using services such as archive.org to provide a permanent public record.

Each document is written as a standalone disclosure, focused on a specific concept, such as heater design, power control methods, cooling structures, or modular construction features.

These publications are not product announcements or final engineering documents — they are intended strictly for defensive publication purposes.

##✍️ Intent

All disclosures are shared openly to promote innovation and safeguard freedom to operate. They are intended to:
- Prevent monopolization of described technical solutions
- Support open research and development
- Serve as public prior art for legal and technical reference

## Disclosures

- `dual_foil_spiral_heater_disclosure.md` – Dual-layer foil heater design enabling improved efficiency and reduced battery current draw through selective activation or surface area expansion.
  - `foil_spiral_heater_temperature_control.md` – Methods of temperature sensing using resistance change, power estimation, airflow, and IR sensing.
- `solid_state_button_vaporizer.md` – Durable button design using magnetic sensor and magnet movement for multi-stage tactile control and haptic feedback.
- `heat_exchanger_vapor_cooling_disclosure.md` – Passive or assisted heat exchanger techniques for improving cooling airflow and surface heat distribution.
- ir_convection_conduction_hybrid_heater_disclosure.md
  - `spiral_heater_assembly_improvement_with_image.md` – Structural optimization allowing longer support rods to pass through the self-wrapped foil tube, simplifying heater assembly, improving alignment, and reducing production difficulty.
