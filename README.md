# Vaporizer Innovation Disclosures

This repository contains technical disclosures of concepts and design innovations related to herbal vaporizer devices. These documents are published to establish **prior art** and prevent third parties from obtaining exclusive patent rights on similar inventions.

All files are timestamped by GitHub’s version control system and may also be archived using services such as archive.org to provide a permanent public record.

Each document is written as a standalone disclosure, focused on a specific concept, such as heater design, power control methods, cooling structures, or modular construction features.

These publications are not product announcements or final engineering documents — they are intended strictly for defensive publication purposes.
