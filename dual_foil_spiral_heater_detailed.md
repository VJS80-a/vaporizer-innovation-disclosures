# Dual-Foil Spiral Heater – Full Technical Disclosure

**Date of Disclosure:** 2025-04-18  
**Inventor:** Ville Johannes Savolainen  
**Disclosure Type:** Public Prior Art

## Introduction

The spiral heater has been used in the Ti N YM ig ht herbal vaporizers since 2019. It consists of thin stainless steel foil, typically 0.05mm thick, but many other thicknesses can be used depending on the desired power and geometry of the heater.

## Core Structure and Assembly Options

In its most used configuration, the foil is attached to a central rod or axle, typically spot welded, and rolled into a spiral that prevents direct foil-to-foil contact, maintaining an air gap between layers.

### Support Structures

To hold the spiral shape:
- Holes can be cut into the foil allowing insertion of small support rods (e.g., zirconia ceramic)
- Heat treatment and molds can permanently shape the foil
- Sacrificial materials can be inserted during forming and removed chemically, mechanically, or by heat

### Conduction Path

Electric current flows from the center to the outer layer:
- A central rod may act as one conductor
- The opposite end can be terminated using spot welded nickel strips or other conductors (silver/copper wires, shaped foil tabs, soldering, or adhesives)

### Spiral Geometry

The spiral is often placed inside a support tube (glass, ceramic, or metal), but this is not strictly necessary. An alternative is to extend the foil past the spiral, allowing it to wrap around itself and form a self-supporting tubular enclosure:
- For example, four layers of 0.05mm foil = 0.2mm thick tube
- Benefits include reduced material costs and lightweight construction
- Efficient heat dissipation and IR shielding due to the foil’s reflective properties

## Multi-Foil Heater Concept

A more recent design includes two or more foil spirals in the same heater unit.

### Benefits of Multi-Foil Setup

- Doubled surface area (better heat transfer)
- Reduced peak current draw (each foil can run at lower current)
- Dynamic power control (activate one or both foils depending on need)
- Improved efficiency and reduced battery stress

### Control Strategies

- PWM control with alternating foil activation
- Each foil may be driven by its own transistor/controller
- Foils may be separated electrically at one end using insulation materials (ceramic paste, mica, etc.)
- Alternatively, they can be operated in parallel (no isolation), acting as one large surface-area heater

### Design Variants

- Welded together at one end (typically the center)
- Ends separately terminated for independent control
- Foils of different thicknesses for thermal profiling
- Optional mid-spiral conductor configuration to control heat delivery to each half independently

## Advantages

- Lower current = less battery sag and longer life
- Fine-grained heat control and faster thermal response
- Enhanced reliability by distributing load
- Flexible adaptation to different airflow/power requirements

## Summary

This disclosure describes a versatile heater construction concept involving one or more spiraled metal foils, various methods of assembly, structural integration techniques, and electrical control schemes that improve heating performance, reduce battery stress, and enable modular vaporizer designs.
