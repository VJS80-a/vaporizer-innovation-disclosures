# Dual-Foil Spiral Heater – Full Technical Disclosure

**Date of Disclosure:** 2025-04-18  
**Inventor:** Ville Johannes Savolainen  
**Disclosure Type:** Public Prior Art

## Introduction

The spiral heater has been used in the Ti N YM ig ht herbal vaporizers since 2019. It consists of thin stainless steel foil, typically 0.05mm thick, but many other thicknesses can be used depending on the desired power and geometry of the heater.

## Core Structure and Assembly Options

In its most used configuration, the foil is attached to a central rod or axle, typically spot welded, and rolled into a spiral that prevents direct foil-to-foil contact, maintaining an air gap between layers.

### Support Structures

To hold the spiral shape:
- Holes can be cut into the foil allowing insertion of small support rods (e.g., zirconia ceramic)
- Heat treatment and molds can permanently shape the foil
- Sacrificial materials can be inserted during forming and removed chemically, mechanically, or by heat

### Conduction Path

Electric current flows from the center to the outer layer:
- A central rod may act as one conductor
- The opposite end can be terminated using spot welded nickel strips or other conductors (silver/copper wires, shaped foil tabs, soldering, or adhesives)

### Spiral Geometry

The spiral is often placed inside a support tube (glass, ceramic, or metal), but this is not strictly necessary. An alternative is to extend the foil past the spiral, allowing it to wrap around itself and form a self-supporting tubular enclosure:
- For example, four layers of 0.05mm foil = 0.2mm thick tube
- Benefits include reduced material costs and lightweight construction
- Efficient heat dissipation and IR shielding due to the foil’s reflective properties

## Multi-Foil Heater Concept

A more recent design includes two or more foil spirals in the same heater unit.

### Benefits of Multi-Foil Setup

- Doubled surface area (better heat transfer)
- Reduced peak current draw (each foil can run at lower current)
- Dynamic power control (activate one or both foils depending on need)
- Improved efficiency and reduced battery stress

### Control Strategies

- PWM control with alternating foil activation
- Each foil may be driven by its own transistor/controller
- Foils may be separated electrically at one end using insulation materials (ceramic paste, mica, etc.)
- Alternatively, they can be operated in parallel (no isolation), acting as one large surface-area heater

### Design Variants

- Welded together at one end (typically the center)
- Ends separately terminated for independent control
- Foils of different thicknesses for thermal profiling
- Optional mid-spiral conductor configuration to control heat delivery to each half independently

## Advantages

- Lower current = less battery sag and longer life
- Fine-grained heat control and faster thermal response
- Enhanced reliability by distributing load
- Flexible adaptation to different airflow/power requirements

  ## Expanded Variations and Broader Scope ## (Added 2025-04-28)

This section expands on the core disclosure to ensure coverage of a wide range of potential implementations, adaptations, and variations of the dual-path spiral foil heater design. The intent is to ensure the described concept is established as prior art in its broader form and prevent any party from claiming exclusive rights to variations that fall under the same core principle.

### 1. Variations in Heater Geometry

- Foil spirals may differ in:
  - Radius or diameter
  - Length, width, or thickness
  - Number of turns
  - Shape: round, elliptical, conical, helical, or irregular
- Dual foils may be:
  - Concentric
  - Interleaved
  - Stacked flat
  - Twisted or layered in parallel but not physically touching

### 2. Electrical Configurations

- Dual or multiple foils may be wired:
  - In **series** (to increase resistance)
  - In **parallel** (to divide current)
  - Independently, with separate MOSFETs or control drivers
- Power may be modulated:
  - Alternating activation (pulsed)
  - Simultaneous but current-limited
  - Based on user-selected or automatic profiles

- Heater foils may be made from:
  - Stainless steel
  - Nichrome
  - Kanthal
  - Titanium
  - Carbon-based conductors or other suitable materials

  - Nickel strip connectors
  - Silver/copper contacts
  - Conductive adhesives or brazing, or other suitable materials

### 4. Structural and Insulating Features

- Foils may be separated or supported by:
  - Embossed ridges or folds in the foil
  - Ceramic spacers
  - Mica sheets or ceramic paste
  - Air gaps or tension-based spacing
  - Anodized metals as aluminum
  - using oxidation of the resistive material as insulation
- Structural housings may include:
  - Glass
  - Metal tubes
  - Ceramic cylinders
  - Self-supporting foil shells

### 5. Dynamic Control Methods

- Heater activation may be controlled by:
  - Software-driven temperature regulation
  - Manual user control (buttons/dials)
  - Sensor feedback (e.g., airflow, temperature, battery voltage)
- Modes may include:
  - Low-power single-foil mode
  - High-power dual-foil mode
  - Alternating foil pulses (e.g., 10ms switching)
  - Adaptive current control based on real-time conditions

### 6. Modular and Replaceable Designs

- Heater cartridges may be:
  - Permanently integrated
  - User-replaceable
  - Hot-swappable
- Contacts and mounts may include:
  - Threaded connections
  - Push-fit electrical terminals
  - Spring-loaded contacts

### 7. Alternative Foil Arrangements

- In addition to spirals, foils may be:
  - Zigzag patterned
  - Serpentine path
  - Layered in flat stacks
  - Rolled into tubes or folded geometries
- Geometry may be designed to emphasize:
  - Surface area for convection
  - Radiant heating efficiency
  - Low current per path for reduced battery stress

### 8. Thermal Management Enhancements

- Additional elements may include:
  - Integrated heat sinks or mass blocks

### 9. Multi-Source Power or Boosting

- Systems may include:
  - Dual batteries or capacitors
  - Flyback boost circuits for short high-power bursts
  - Load-sharing between foils or heating zones

### 10. Target Applications

While the intended use is for portable dry herb vaporizers, the concepts here can be applied to:

- Aromatherapy devices
- Portable soldering tools
- Compact industrial heaters
- Any system requiring resistive heating with minimal power draw and small form factor
