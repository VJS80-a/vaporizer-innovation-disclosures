# Heat Exchanger & Vapor Cooling Structure for Portable Vaporizers

**Date of Disclosure:** 2025-04-18  
**Inventor:** Ville Johannes Savolainen  
**Disclosure Type:** Public Prior Art

## 1. Problem Overview

In portable vaporizers, one of the major challenges is twofold:
- Keeping the **vapor temperature low enough** to avoid airway irritation
- Preventing the **device exterior** from becoming uncomfortably hot

This invention addresses both by introducing an integrated **heat exchange and cooling system** that improves user comfort and energy efficiency.

---

## 2. Basic Concept

The vapor, typically between **150–200 °C**, is cooled by directing it through **conductive channels** (e.g., aluminum, copper, stainless steel). At the same time, the fresh **intake air**, drawn by the user’s inhalation, flows separately but in close proximity to the hot vapor path.

The heat from the vapor is transferred into the cooling metal structure, and then into the fresh air before it reaches the heater. This has two major effects:
- The vapor is cooled, improving comfort
- The intake air is preheated, **reducing the heater's energy load**

## 3. Implementation Methods

### 3.1 Cooling / Heat Exchange Structures

- **Parallel plates**: One side conducts vapor, the other conducts intake air
- **Metal tubing arrays**: Hot vapor flows through small tubes conductively coupled to fins or plates in the intake air path
- **Turbulence regions**: Direct vapor across zig-zag or staggered surfaces to increase heat transfer
- **Spiral tunnels / double walls**: Enclose vapor path in an air-jacketed structure

### 3.2 Modular Designs

- **Clip-on Cooling Panel**: A cooling unit clipped to the top panel of the vaporizer, maximizing use of surface area with minimal added height
- **Replaceable Top Section**: A removable top module containing the cooling system, including full airflow isolation and integrated heat exchange

## 4. Materials and Construction

Materials for the heat exchanger include:
- Cast, machined, or pressed **aluminum**
- **Copper** (optionally gold-plated)
- **Stainless steel**, or **anodized metals**

Construction ensures that:
- **Hot vapor** and **fresh air** are physically separated
- Heat is transferred through the shared **metal walls** or surfaces
- Structures allow for **large surface area** in a **compact volume**

---

## 5. Efficiency Principles

- **High conductivity**, **low heat capacity** materials are preferred (e.g., thin aluminum) to prevent energy waste
- Lightweight designs respond quickly to short, fast inhalations
- Heat is transferred directly without storing much thermal energy in the cooler itself
- Mimics HVAC-style **heat recovery systems** used in buildings

---

## 6. Benefits

- **Efficient vapor cooling** with essentially unlimited capacity due to continuous heat transfer to incoming air
- **Preheating intake air** improves energy efficiency and reduces battery load
- **Main heater requires less temperature ramp** to reach vaporization range
- **Cooler external surfaces**, since waste heat is recycled instead of radiated outward

---

## 7. Summary & Intent

This invention introduces a vaporizer cooling system that not only reduces vapor temperature but reclaims heat to reduce energy use. By transferring heat from outgoing vapor into the incoming air stream using thermally conductive structures, the system improves performance, efficiency, and user comfort.
